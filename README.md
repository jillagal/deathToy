# deathToy

How does cell turnover affect phenotypic evolution in a tumor with heterogeneity in proliferation rates and migration speeds? In this off-lattice agent-based simulation the user can vary proliferation-migration trade-offs, death rate, and whether death occurs in response to demographic or environmental stochasticity.

The bash script defines the main arguments in the paper. The code outputs a movie folder with gifs and the data folder contains a file with populations over time, and files with averages and standard deviations of proliferation and migration rates over time.
